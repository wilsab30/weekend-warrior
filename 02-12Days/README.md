# 12 Days of Xmas

Write a program that prints out all of the lyrics to the traditional song _The Twelve Days of Christmas_.

## Specifications
- You don't have to worry about capitalization; the entire text can be case insensitive.
- You can sensibly ignore any punctuation. Commas and periods can be ignored.
- There should be a blank line between each verse.
- You must ordinalize your numbers: "first day of Christmas", "Four calling birds", etc.
- If there's more than one gift in a specific verse, the last line should begin with "and".
- The verse always begins with _On the N day of Christmas my true love game to me_.
- The gift for day five is always upper case because everyone remembers that one and sings it real loud.

### The gifts, in case you can't remember
- twelve drummers drumming
- eleven pipers piping
- ten lords-a-leaping
- nine ladies dancing
- eight maids-a-milking
- seven swans-a-swimming
- six geese-a-laying
- FIVE GOLDEN RINGS
- four calling birds
- three french hens
- two turtle doves
- and a partridge in a pear tree
